## Introduction
This repository is a school project leaded at Ensta Bretagne about the building of a car and his automating. The car is a one-tenth scale replica and was built with 3d printing, turning and milling. Here is a picture of the final result of his building.

## Automating
After the building of this car, we need to robotize it. In order to do that, we decided to use a Raspberry Pi 4 and some sensors.
