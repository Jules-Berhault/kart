# Kart

## Introduction
This repository is a school project leaded at Ensta Bretagne about the building of a car and his automating. The car is a one-tenth scale replica and was built with 3d printing, turning and milling. Here is a picture of the final result of his building.

## Building
This car was designed using Autodesk Inventor and the files are available in the cao folder.

## Automating
After the building of this car, we need to robotize it. In order to do that, we decided to use a Raspberry Pi 3B+ and some sensors.

| Sensors       | Used             | Dope-Level               |
| ------------- |:----------------:|:------------------------:|
| GNSS          |:x:               |:turtle::boom::dash::poop:|
| Inertial Unit |:x:               |:rainbow:                 |
| Pi camera     |:heavy_check_mark:|:unicorn:                 |

We decided to use **ROS** (**R**obot **O**perating **S**ystem), the well-known Middleware for mobile robotics. We created our own nodes to control this robot.

## Simulation
A simulator is implemented in V-REP in order to check system behavior in simulation. This simulation is base interfaced with ROS via a LUA script which control the simulated car in the V-REP environment. It let us cerify our node without any changes because the low level nodes are replaced by the ROS-V-REP linker.
