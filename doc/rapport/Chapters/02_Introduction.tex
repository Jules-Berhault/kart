\paragraph{}In the middleware module of UV 4.1, we are asked to implement the ROS middleware to drive a small car built in the previous semester. 
This small project consists in driving around an athletics track in an autonomous way. 
To carry out this project we have various sensors such as the Inertielle control unit which estimates the heading of the car and its acceleration, the camera, 
the gps which will allow us to estimate the position of the small car. We also have an on-board computer, in this case a raspberry.
