To conclude, we think that we already have a strong basis for this project, particularly
with the ROS structure  which is already setup. Then we have to perform test with the
real system because the simulation is correctly working and a good proof of concept, 
but we lnow too that simulation and reality are always different. We have to do some
improvements on our projetc too, like adding an mission controler in order to control the
robot in some cases where we couldn't use the line following command, for instance when the 
camera is not seeing any lines, and we ha to add a GUI in order to show the kart state
like his position, is speed and the circuit.
