\section{Introduction}
\paragraph{}In the middleware module of UV 4.1, we learned one of the most used software architectures in robotics: Robot operating System. In this module we learned the basics of ROS and its importance in a robotics project. In order to apply the knowledge acquired in ROS to a concrete project, we were asked to carry out the KART project. 
This small project consists in driving around an athletics track in an autonomous way.

The Kart project consists in making a small car autonomous. In addition to this, the car must be able to do a complete tour of an athletics track. 
To carry out this project, we have various sensors such as an inertial measurement unit that estimates the direction and acceleration of the car, a camera, a GPS that will allow us to estimate the position of the small car. We also have an on-board computer, in this case a raspberry
